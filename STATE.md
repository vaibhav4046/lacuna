# State

What exists right now. Updated as things change, and never ahead of them.

**Last updated: 2026-08-12**

## Built and verified

- Repository initialised 2026-08-12. No code, assets or history imported from
  anywhere.
- Hackathon rules captured verbatim to
  [artifacts/rules/](artifacts/rules/hackhydra-rules-2026-08-12.txt) and mapped
  requirement by requirement in [docs/RULES_MATRIX.md](docs/RULES_MATRIX.md).
- Upstream HydraDB documentation read at pinned commit
  `02a40025d2d57e97ab2754c8256219cdbfeab379`, with what was read and what it
  settled recorded in [docs/SOURCE_LOG.md](docs/SOURCE_LOG.md).
- Track, thesis and data model decided and written up as ADRs
  [0001](docs/adr/0001-track-and-thesis.md) and
  [0002](docs/adr/0002-temporal-evidence-graph.md).
- Ubuntu 24.04 provisioned under WSL2 with HydraDB's native dependencies.
  Verified present: `libcypher-parser 0.6.2`, `libgraphblas.so.7.4.0`,
  Rust stable, `just 1.58.0`.
- HydraDB cloned at the pinned commit and `just native-check` passes.
- HydraDB built from source and running locally. Upstream `AGENTS.md` steps 3
  through 8 all executed, with the real output committed to
  [artifacts/hydradb/](artifacts/hydradb/README.md):
  - `just smoke` printed `graph object-store smoke passed at epoch 10`
  - `scripts/runtime_smoke.sh` printed `runtime-smoke-ok`
  - the node serves `/readyz` and reports `graph_runtime_ready 1`
  - a write over HTTP came back over HTTP as exactly one row,
    `{"type":"vertex_id","value":2}`, at `read_epoch` 1
  - the same fact read back over Bolt with the Neo4j Python driver 6.2.0,
    printing `{'id': 2}`

  Both transports work against the same node. This is the upstream pass
  condition, not a port check.

- The Cypher subset probed with 119 executed queries across three rounds, with
  every request and response committed to
  [artifacts/cypher-probe/](artifacts/cypher-probe/README.md). Round three ends
  34 of 34 passing, and its reads assert on exact row values rather than on the
  query being accepted. Every construct ADR 0002 depends on either works or has
  a working substitute that was also executed. Three statements in that ADR
  turned out to be wrong about the running engine and are corrected in its
  amendment, with the original text left visible.

## In progress

- The HydraDB client adapter and its contract tests, now written against forms
  that are known to execute rather than against the compatibility document.

## Not built yet

Everything else. Named explicitly so no reader has to guess:

- No application code
- No HydraDB client adapter
- No ingestion pipeline
- No demo corpus
- No retrieval or abstention logic
- No user interface
- No tests
- No benchmark harness, and therefore no numbers of any kind
- No screenshots
- No deployment
- No demo video

## Known environment deviations

Two, recorded because reproducibility depends on them.

**`just` shebang recipes fail under WSL2.** `just 1.58.0` writes shebang recipe
scripts into `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/just/`, and WSL mounts `/run/user/0` as tmpfs with
`noexec`. Every shebang recipe therefore dies with:

```
error: recipe `native-check` with shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash` execution error: Permission denied (os error 13)
```

Confirmed with `strace`: the `execve` of `/run/user/0/just/just-*/native-check`
returns `EACCES`. It is neither a HydraDB bug nor a missing dependency. Handled
without modifying any recipe, by unsetting `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or passing
`just --tempdir`, both of which were tested.

**`/tmp` is cleaned under this distro.** `/tmp/sgk-venv` and `/tmp/sgk-env.sh`,
created during step 5, were gone by the time step 8 ran roughly fifteen minutes
later. This is not a surprise so much as a confirmation: upstream already says
the `/tmp/sgk-*` paths are disposable and that anything meant to be kept belongs
elsewhere. The consequence for this project is concrete, so it is written down
rather than remembered. Lacuna's own HydraDB data directory will not live in
`/tmp`, because a demo whose store evaporates between sessions is not a demo.

## Open questions

- ~~Whether the supported Cypher subset expresses every query
  [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-temporal-evidence-graph.md) assumes.~~ **Settled
  2026-08-12** by executing all of them. It does, with two changes to how, not
  to what: edges are written one statement each because `UNWIND` upserts
  vertices only, and the "is this claim current" check projects the superseder's
  id instead of counting, because `count(<binding>)` does not parse. Evidence in
  [artifacts/cypher-probe/](artifacts/cypher-probe/README.md).

- Whether one HTTP round trip per edge is fast enough at demo corpus size. It is
  a throughput question with a measurable answer, and it gets measured when the
  ingestion pipeline exists rather than guessed at now. If it is too slow the
  fallback is Bolt, which is already verified working against the same node.
